# Rick and Morty Character Sort 

If you're wondering why the name of this repo is "burger", it's because the class instructions were written with a burger theme in mind. 

1. Purpose.

"Creating" and "removing" characters from a room using a Rick and Morty theme. 

The app is designed to: 

    A. Allow a user to add a character.  
    B. Create an ordered list of characters, with a button next to each. 
    C. Click the kick them out button, and move each character to a new ordered list. 
    D. Click a final button and destroy that character. 

2. How it works: 

    1. The app takes in the user's text using jquery. 
    2. The app pushes the text into an ordered list using an ajax post method. 
    3. Handlebars assisted buttons accompany the ordered list, and a series of if statements determine which room to place the characters in. 
    4. A final allows the user to delete a character. 

3. To run the APP: 
   Simply type into the character name box, and click add character (it doesn't actually matter if you type a real character, any text will do). 

4. The app uses: 
    Javascript
    npm: 
    express
    handlebars 
    bootstrap
    jquery
    css
